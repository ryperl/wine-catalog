# Cellar Location Enhancement

## ✅ **Enhanced Wine Model with Detailed Cellar Location Tracking**

### 🏗️ **New Cellar Location Structure**

The wine model now includes a comprehensive cellar location system with the following fields:

```typescript
interface IWineCellarLocation {
  room?: string;      // e.g., "Main Cellar", "Climate Room", "Basement"
  rack?: string;      // e.g., "A1", "B2", "C3"
  shelf?: string;     // e.g., "1", "2", "3", "4", "5"
  position?: string;  // e.g., "12", "3-4", "20-23"
  notes?: string;     // e.g., "Special reserve section", "Easy access for young wines"
}
```

### 📊 **Current Cellar Distribution (100 wines)**

- **Main Cellar**: 50 wines (50%)
- **Climate Room**: 30 wines (30%) 
- **Basement**: 20 wines (20%)

### 🔍 **New API Filtering Capabilities**

1. **Filter by Cellar Room**: `?cellarRoom=Main%20Cellar`
2. **Filter by Rack**: `?cellarRack=A1`
3. **Combined Filters**: `?cellarRoom=Climate%20Room&cellarRack=B2`

### 🧪 **API Examples**

```bash
# Get all wines in Main Cellar
GET /api/wines?cellarRoom=Main%20Cellar

# Get wines in specific rack
GET /api/wines?cellarRack=A1

# Get wines in Climate Room with red style
GET /api/wines?cellarRoom=Climate%20Room&style=red
```

### 📋 **Sample Cellar Data**

```json
{
  "cellar": {
    "quantity": 1,
    "location": {
      "room": "Main Cellar",
      "rack": "C3",
      "shelf": "4", 
      "position": "15",
      "notes": "Special reserve section"
    },
    "purchasePrice": 500,
    "purchaseDate": "2021-08-25T00:00:00.000Z",
    "drinkBy": "2033-12-31T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

### 🎯 **Benefits for Wine Collectors**

1. **Precise Location Tracking**: Know exactly where each bottle is stored
2. **Inventory Management**: Easily find wines by location
3. **Organization**: Categorize by storage conditions (climate-controlled, etc.)
4. **Notes**: Add specific storage notes for special bottles
5. **API Filtering**: Query wines by storage location through the API
