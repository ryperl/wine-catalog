# Feature Request: Wine Bottle Image Recognition

## üìã Feature Overview

Add the ability to capture or upload a photo of a wine bottle to automatically extract and pre-populate wine information in the add wine form, reducing manual data entry and improving user experience.

## üéØ User Story

**As a wine collector,** I want to take a picture of a wine bottle and have the app automatically extract wine details, **so that** I can quickly add wines to my collection without manually typing all the information.

## üîß Technical Implementation Plan

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Image Capture Component
```typescript
// Component: ImageCapture.tsx
interface ImageCaptureProps {
  onImageCaptured: (image: File) => void;
  onExtractedData: (wineData: Partial<IWine>) => void;
}
```

**Features:**
- Camera access for live photo capture
- File upload for existing photos
- Image preview with crop/rotate functionality
- Loading states during processing

#### 2. Enhanced Add Wine Form
```typescript
// Component: AddWineForm.tsx
interface AddWineFormProps {
  initialData?: Partial<IWine>;
  isFromImageExtraction?: boolean;
}
```

**Features:**
- Pre-populated fields from image extraction
- Clear indication of auto-filled vs. manual fields
- Ability to edit and correct extracted data
- Confidence indicators for extracted fields

### Backend API Endpoints

#### 1. Image Processing Endpoint
```typescript
POST /api/wines/extract-from-image
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Request:
- image: File (JPEG/PNG, max 10MB)

Response:
{
  success: boolean;
  data: {
    extractedData: Partial<IWine>;
    confidence: {
      [fieldName: string]: number; // 0-1 confidence score
    };
    processingTime: number;
  };
}
```

#### 2. Image Storage Endpoint
```typescript
POST /api/wines/:id/images
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Request:
- image: File
- type: 'bottle' | 'label' | 'back_label'

Response:
{
  success: boolean;
  data: {
    imageUrl: string;
    imageId: string;
  };
}
```

### Computer Vision Integration

#### Option 1: Google Cloud Vision API
```typescript
// Service: GoogleVisionService.ts
class GoogleVisionService {
  async extractWineData(imageBuffer: Buffer): Promise<ExtractedWineData> {
    // Use OCR to extract text
    // Use object detection for bottle recognition
    // Parse extracted text for wine information
  }
}
```

**Capabilities:**
- OCR text extraction from labels
- Logo/brand recognition
- Structured data parsing

#### Option 2: Azure Computer Vision
```typescript
// Service: AzureVisionService.ts
class AzureVisionService {
  async analyzeWineBottle(imageBuffer: Buffer): Promise<ExtractedWineData> {
    // Custom model training for wine bottles
    // Text extraction and parsing
    // Brand and vintage recognition
  }
}
```

#### Option 3: Custom ML Model
```typescript
// Service: CustomVisionService.ts
class CustomVisionService {
  async processWineImage(imageBuffer: Buffer): Promise<ExtractedWineData> {
    // TensorFlow.js or similar for client-side processing
    // Custom trained model for wine label recognition
  }
}
```

### Data Extraction Logic

#### Text Processing Pipeline
```typescript
interface ExtractedWineData {
  name?: string;
  producer?: string;
  vintage?: number;
  region?: {
    country?: string;
    area?: string;
  };
  grapes?: string[];
  style?: WineStyle;
  alcohol?: number;
  confidence: Record<string, number>;
}

class WineDataExtractor {
  async extractFromText(ocrText: string): Promise<ExtractedWineData> {
    // Pattern matching for wine information
    // Named entity recognition
    // Confidence scoring
  }
}
```

**Extraction Patterns:**
- **Vintage:** 4-digit years (1900-current)
- **Alcohol:** Percentage patterns (e.g., "13.5% ABV")
- **Producer:** Company name patterns
- **Region:** Geographic location patterns
